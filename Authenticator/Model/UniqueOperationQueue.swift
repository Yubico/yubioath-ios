* This operation queue can dedup operations.
* To avoid putting in queue operations that already waiting for execution
* Use add method to add operation and it will skip adding if operation already exists
* Also it allows to suspend and resume the queue and controlling syncronization of that switch,
* so it's recommended to use suspendQueue method instead of direct flag isSuspended for multithreading support
