            - Fixed the bug where deleting an account would cause a sync issue between the YubiKey and Yubico Authenticator.
            - Storage of passwords in the keychain has been improved and now uses the derived access key. Old stored passwords will be migrated automatically.
            - The previous settings for account creation are no longer re-used for the next account.
            - Menu items for account and configuration are now disabled on iPads when no YubiKey is inserted into the device.
